## Hello there
### thanks for dropping in!

---

I'm a web developer with three years of professional experience working the full stack, but specialize in front end technologies.

Specifically, I have a passion for the React.JS ecosystem and have found endless enjoyment in building unique user experiences since transitioning from hospitality to software during the pandemic.

My most relevant projects are pinned.

---

I enjoy Star Wars, gaming, finance, philosophy and music.

Happily married and a cat dad.

Mostly trying to find my place in this new world and love sharing my experience with others.

I aspire to make meaningful contributions to the world and to my community - other than good code and cool apps, of course.
