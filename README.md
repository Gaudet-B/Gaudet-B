## Hello there
### thanks for dropping in!

---

I'm a recent coding bootcamp graduate (I've left all those repos untouched as artifacts) who is looking for freelancing and open source work.

My most relevant projects are pinned.

---

I enjoy Star Wars, gaming, finance, philosophy and music.

Happily married and a cat dad.

Mostly trying to find my place in this new world and love sharing my experience with others.

I aspire to make meaningful contributions to the world and to my community - other than good code and cool apps, of course.
